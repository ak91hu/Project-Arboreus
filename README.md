**The Arboreus Algorithm** is an educational puzzle game designed to visualize the logic behind Binary Search Trees (BST) and Red-black trees. Built with Java and LibGDX, it challenges players to construct a valid data structure in real-time under constraints, blending gamification with algorithmic learning.
